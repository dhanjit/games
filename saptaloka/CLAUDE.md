# Saptaloka — Claude notes

A Reigns-style mythology rogue-like, mobile-web. Pure static — no build, no
deps. Player-facing docs are in the repo [README.md](../README.md); this file
captures non-obvious things for editing the code. Everything Saptaloka lives in
this `saptaloka/` folder (the repo root is a game-agnostic hub — see the root
`CLAUDE.md`).

## Architecture in 30 seconds

```
saptaloka/index.html  → loads cards.js, then game.js (order matters)
cards.js    → exposes window.SAPTALOKA = { REALMS, CARDS } (data only)
game.js     → IIFE; reads window.SAPTALOKA at boot
style.css   → CSS vars in :root drive the theme; mobile-first, safe-area aware
manifest.webmanifest → PWA install metadata; icons in icons/ (PNG)
sw.js       → offline service worker (precache + stale-while-revalidate)
```

No bundler. No transpiler. Modern-browser ES (template literals, optional
chaining, `Object.fromEntries`) is fine. Don't introduce a build step unless
explicitly asked — it would defeat the "open `index.html` and play" promise.

## Running locally

`manifest.webmanifest` and the relative paths require an HTTP origin — opening
`index.html` directly via `file://` is unreliable. Always serve from the repo
root:

```
cd /c/Users/dhanj/Code/games
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/saptaloka/` for the game (or
`http://localhost:8080` for the hub). For phone testing on the same wifi, use
the machine's LAN IP. iOS PWA install: Share → Add to Home Screen.

## Card data — invariants and gotchas

- Normal card gating uses **`realmMin` / `realmMax`** (1..7, inclusive).
- Boss card gating uses **`realm: <n>` + `tag: 'boss'`**, exactly one per
  realm. `pickBossForRealm` does `find`, not filter — duplicates silently lose.
- Bosses are auto-drawn at the last step of each realm; do not put them in the
  normal pool.
- `weight` defaults to 1 if omitted.
- `recentIds` keeps the last 7 drawn cards out of the pool. If a too-narrow
  realm filter empties the pool, the engine wipes `recentIds` and falls back to
  the first non-boss card — adding very few cards for a realm produces
  noticeable repeats.
- `fx` can be a **plain object** *or* a **zero-arg function** returning one
  (see `randomNagaEffect`). The Sage's Eye preview only renders for object
  effects — function fx silently shows no preview. If you want a preview for a
  randomized choice, decide the fx at draw time, not on commit.
- `next: 'cardId'` is documented in the README as the chaining mechanism, but
  the current engine doesn't read it — `commitChoice` always calls
  `drawNextCard()`. If chaining is needed, route through `state.nextCardOverride`
  (already present) or extend `commitChoice`.

## Stats — end conditions are asymmetric

Range is 0..100 nominal but the engine deliberately leaves room above/below
during `applyFx` so `checkEnd` can detect overflow:

| stat   | dies at 0 | hits 100                       | clamped before check |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| prana  | yes       | no (caps at 100)               | yes (capped to 100)  |
| tejas  | yes       | yes (burnout death)            | no                   |
| karma  | yes (sin) | false summit (Svarga, non-win) | no                   |
| bhakti | yes       | false summit (Deva, non-win)   | no                   |

`checkEnd()` returns a key string (e.g. `'death_prana'`, `'false_karma'`) or
`null`; `endRun` looks it up in `ENDINGS`. Karma/bhakti `>=100` return
`false_karma` / `false_bhakti` (`kind: 'falsesummit'`) — these end the run as a
non-win dead-end: **no `meta.moksha++`, no +25 puṇya** (granted only by the true
win). So a `+30` swing that pushes karma past 100 is **not** a win — it ends the
run at a false summit (Svarga/Deva). The **only** win is completing realm 7,
which calls `endRun('win_moksha')` (`kind: 'win'`). Prāṇa is the only "more is
better, capped" stat. When designing boss fx, remember the `>=100` exits exist —
overshooting karma/bhakti on a boss is a viable false-summit ending, but it does
not grant mokṣa.

`Second Breath` only saves prāṇa-zero deaths. The other four end conditions
ignore it.

Two Mirror upgrades add post-effect transforms in `applyFx` (default off — both
factors are 1 without the upgrade):
- **Pilgrim's Stamina** (`pranaDrainFactor` < 1) scales *negative* prāṇa deltas
  only (drains hit softer).
- **Equanimity** (`temperanceFactor` < 1) soft-compresses **karma and bhakti**
  above 82 toward the cap, to blunt the over-virtue "false-summit" exits. It does
  **not** touch tejas — burnout (`tejas >= 100`) must stay reachable, so don't add
  tejas to that loop. The `showPreview` (Sage's Eye) badge mirrors all three
  transforms (prāṇa cap, drain-softening, karma/bhakti damping) so the preview
  equals the floating delta — keep them in sync if you change `applyFx`.

Realms were trimmed to 5·6·6·7·7·8·8 (47 encounters) and card-gain magnitudes
softened so the full climb to Satyaloka is reachable with skill; the Mirror is
the difficulty ramp. Re-run `/tmp`-style engine simulations after balance edits.

## Meta-progression / persistence

- localStorage key: **`saptaloka.meta.v1`**.
- If you change the meta shape (new fields on `meta`, new `state` flags from
  upgrades) in a backwards-incompatible way, **bump the key** to `.v2` and
  drop a one-shot migration in `loadMeta`. Don't silently break saves —
  `Object.assign(defaultMeta(), JSON.parse(raw))` only patches missing keys, it
  doesn't reshape existing ones.
- Adding an upgrade: append to `UPGRADES` in [game.js](game.js). The `apply`
  function mutates `state` at run-start (called from `applyStartingUpgrades`).
  Costs are an array — length defines the max level. State flags set here
  (`secondBreath`, `preview`, `graceBonus`, `temperanceFactor`,
  `pranaDrainFactor`) must also be reset at run-start in `applyStartingUpgrades`
  (currently hand-listed at the top of that function).
- `meta.bestRealm` is 1-indexed; the realm-name lookup compensates.

## Swipe / input

- Touch and mouse share `onPointer*` handlers. iOS double-tap-to-zoom is
  defeated by the global `touchend` guard — don't remove it.
- Commit threshold: **30% of card width** OR **0.6 px/ms** velocity. Tweak in
  `onPointerUp`.
- `card` element is reused across encounters — `renderCard` resets its
  transform/opacity in two phases with a forced reflow (`void card.offsetWidth`).
  Skipping the reflow makes the entry transition vanish.

## CSS theme

All colors live as CSS vars in `:root`. Per-stat colors are
`--stat-prana/tejas/karma/bhakti`. Layout sizing uses `--card-w` /
`--card-h` and `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for iOS notch/home-indicator. Editing
the dark mythology palette is one block in [style.css](style.css); avoid
hard-coding colors elsewhere.

## PWA / Android packaging

The game is wrapped as a Trusted Web Activity for the Play Store (see the
`saptaloka-android-play` memory and [store/RUNBOOK.md](store/RUNBOOK.md)).
Saptaloka-specific packaging files and their non-obvious rules:

- **`sw.js`** is a stale-while-revalidate service worker that precaches the static
  assets (offline + installability). **Bump `CACHE` (`saptaloka-v1` → `-v2` …)
  whenever you change any cached file** (`ASSETS` list), or returning players keep
  the old build. Add new asset files to the `ASSETS` array too.
- **`icons/*.png`** are real raster icons (Android/Play can't use the inline-SVG
  data-URI favicon). Regenerate from the ॐ glyph with `@resvg/resvg-js` + the
  Windows `Nirmala.ttc` Devanagari font if the look changes; `manifest.webmanifest`
  references them (192 `any`, 512 `any`, 512 `maskable` as **separate** entries).
  `apple-touch-icon.png` is iOS-only (iOS ignores manifest icons).
- **`store/`** holds Play-listing artifacts (feature graphic, store icon, listing
  copy, runbook) — kept inside this folder so Saptaloka stays self-contained.
- **Digital Asset Links** are the one exception that *can't* live in this folder:
  the TWA needs `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` at the **domain root**
  (`games.dhanjit.me`, NOT under `/saptaloka/`), carrying the Play **app-signing**
  key SHA-256 (not the upload key). It's a shared, domain-level file (one JSON
  array, one entry per game) at the repo root — see the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## What not to do

- Don't add a framework, bundler, or package.json.
- Don't break the `cards.js` → `game.js` script order, or the
  `window.SAPTALOKA` global handoff.
- Don't auto-clamp `tejas` / `karma` / `bhakti` to 100 — that disables the
  run-end conditions. (Equanimity *soft-compresses* karma/bhakti above 82 only
  when the upgrade is owned, and never touches tejas, so the burnout death stays
  reachable — keep it that way.)
- Don't reuse the localStorage key for an incompatible meta shape.
- Don't reach for `fetch`/network calls in **game code** — the game must work
  fully offline once cached. (`sw.js` uses `fetch` for caching; that's the only
  place it belongs.)
